## Create Name and Logo

### Notes

1. Do not use your name. It's hard to link to what it is: a truck business
2. Use a name that makes clear the business. This stands up over competitors
3. Shopify offers a [Business Name Generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator)
4. Find a domain name for the business name
5. Create logo for free on [Canva](https://www.canva.com)
6. Or use [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) or other AI Image Generator
7. Or pay someone on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com)
